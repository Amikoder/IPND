            People with computers download browsers; browsers, using HTTP, send out queries and return web pages plucked from super-space-saving filing-cabinet computers called servers...hidden in air conditioned closets. <!--or warehouses! no offense meant-->
           </p>
           <p>
            These pages are usually formatted using HTML, 
            <b>hypertext markup language</b>, and can contain <em>almost anything</em>: text, images, videos, links, pdf's, multiple levels.  The browser reads the text, markup and references to turn the information into something user-friendly.
           </p>
          </div>

         Elements

       <div class="notes">
         <p>
           Elements are used in markup, which controls how a webp age, and its content, are rendered by the browser.  Elements consist, usually, of an <b>opening tag, content, and a closing tag</b>. Some elements, called <span class="bold">void tags</span>, don't need closing tags. 
          </p>
             <div class="code_box"> 
              Void Tags:

                Line break: &lt;br&gt; 
                and the image element: &lt;img  src="url" alt="text"&gt; 

               Non-Void Tags:
                Bold, and/or Strong: &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;text&lt;/strong&gt;
            </div>
         <p>
            Elements can be either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.  Inline elements create no additional space around them and can "butt" right up against text.  Block elements create a box in which their content resides. 
         </p>   
              <div class="code_box">
                Line break &lt;br&gt; is inline, but paragraph &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<p>is block text</p> and created the space preceding and following the above line. 
              </div>
         <p>
            But both are necessary to manage the "white space" on an HTML page, since spaces and carriage returns are rendered null when a browser reads HTML. Multiple spaces and any carriage returns are turned into a single space.  Space, therefore, has to be deliberately coded in.
         </p>
         <p>
           Attributes, span/div
         <br>
           Attributes modify their elements, or are properties of elements. Span and Div, for instance, can have attributes added to them. Both elements contain text, Span is inline and Div is block.  Neither are void tags.  Div behaves much like the paragraph tag, but doesn't create as much space around it.

          Learning Code from Other Pages

      <div class="notes">
        <p>
          Looking at the code of existing web pages provides excellent examples of code-in-action. Not only can you see the end product, but <em>how</em> the elements and style are formatted correctly to follow HTML (or CSS) syntax and rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Chrome's <b>developer tools</b> provides user-friendly ways to sift through complex HTML structure, as well as see how coders are minimizing redundancy (and errors). It's called a tool because not only can you use it, but through that use you add coding skill to your belt, so to speak.  
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML structure can be complex due to the <b>"tree-like"</b> nature of it. Within elements lie additional elements.  This causes the wavy pattern we see when looking at HTML code; the further <b>indented</b> something is, the deeper it's nested. And, when looking at the page itself, this nesting is rendered as boxes within boxes (though the borders of the boxes may be invisible).
        </p>
        <p>
         Programmer's text editors also make learning/performing programming easier.  Programs for writing programs! Or web pages, in this case.  They will, for instance, provide a corresponding closing tag for your opening one.
        </p>
      </div>

   <div class="section" id="1.box">
         <div class="section-title">
          Boxes
         </div>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>
          Everything on a web page falls within the confines of a box. There's a standard model for the creation and formatting of boxes.
        </p>
          <img class ="box" src="boxmodel-image.png" alt="Box Model" style="width:304px;height:228px">
        <p>
          The padding, border, and margin all have the capability of being customized with differing sizes.  The total size of the box is from top margin to bottom, and right to left.  So, margin width (or height) plus border width plus padding width plus content width.  These values can be set in pixels, or percentages.  Percentages change with the screen size, but pixels are fixed.  If using pixels, the max width option can help maintain the integrity of a box.  Speaking of integrity, it's important to  make sure boxes will be rendered correctly across browsers.  Browser specific prefixes such as webkit, moz, and ms with the style definition will help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boxes must be positioned on the page as well.  Without defining the box values, the box will go the whole width of a page.  Using a flex box will allow boxes to sit next to each other.  Manipulating individual values will also help place boxes.  
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also helpful to think of block elements as creating boxes around them, while inline elements go within boxes.  Some box elements have to be structured within one another as well. The paragraph element, for instance, has to be within div(ision?) elements.  If you try to put a div within a paragraph, your code will not verify though the browser may be able to render it how you intended.

         CSS
     </div>
      <div class="notes">
         <p> 
           As mentioned previously, CSS controls how an HTML page <em>looks</em>.  It also saves coders substantial time by allowing them to apply a repetitive style to multiple elements of the same type.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are three ways to add style to a page:
         <br>
          1. Writing it in the head element of the HTML page. 
         <br>
          2. Within the head element, add a link to a separate CSS file. This keeps large projects organized, and looks something like this:
         </p>
            <div class="code_box">
              &lt;link: rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css"&gt;
            </div>
         <p>
          3. Writing the style inline with the HTML.  Not the best choice, leads to a lot of repetition.

         <p>
           CSS both helps avoid repetition and maintain consistency by applying a singular style to an unlimited number of instances of the same element. This, handily enough, also makes implementing changes easier. It's also ruled by an abstract concept called inheritance.  In a page of CSS code, the most specific rule applies. If a class has a specific attribute, and there's a class nested within it without any attributes specified, the nested class shares the attribute of the parent (ancestor) class.

               "h1" is the selector.

            Variables in programming are similar to variables in algebra.  A value is assigned a designation, the name composed of <b>underscores, letters, and numbers</b> (though it can't start with a number), and until that designation is assigned another value, the name can be used in expressions to represent that value.  For the computer to understand the use of a variable, a programmer has to use an <b>assignment statement</b>.

                nanostick = speed_of_light * billionth * 100
                
                And the command "print nanostick" will direct the computer to execute the equation:
                
                299792458 * (1.0 / 1000000000) * 100

              Some benefits of using variables include improving code readability, storing a singular value of data, and a way to change that value.  The fewer times you have to write out 9 digit numbers, the fewer chances for error.

           A <b>string</b> is a sequence of characters contained within quotes--single or double.  It must start and end with the same type of quote character, but can contain the other type within it. Keep an eye on how the python interpreter changes the color when strings are inserted.  Strings can be assigned to variables.

              Errors and glitches (<b>Bugs</b>) are a normal part of programming, so the best way to minimize down-time and maximize both efficiency and productivity is to have a systematic way of finding and fixing them.  An important side note: when something doesn't behave properly, the errant code doesn't have to be useless.  Unexpected results can lead to a new way of doing something else.  Theoretically.  
             </p>
             <p> 
               Reading the actual error message will help pinpoint the mistaken code, as well as define what kind of error it is.  Further, "Googling" the error will lead to possible solutions.
             </p>
             <p>
               When re-purposing a snippet of code from another source doesn't work correctly, try commenting out the broken code and copying in the source code.  This not only makes sure that the source is viable, but allows for easy rewriting with minimized chance for error. 
             </p>
             <p>
               If code behaves oddly try adding in print statements until you come to the line that doesn't work as intended.
             </p>
             <p>
               Keep multiple versions, and check for errors as you edit.  Undo doesn't quite do the trick. A spare file will do just as well as powerful programs designed for version organization.

            OOP involves working with structures of data and methods, objects, rather than actions and logic.  Just like CSS can be used to give all similar structures the same visual attributes, OOP can be used to give similar data sets the same functionality.  Each concept has defined characteristics and ways of working with it, and from that one definition each particular instance or object can be manipulated. Just like CSS. By defining concepts, when changes need to be implemented only the concept must be altered, not each instance of it.  Just like CSS. Similarly, the programmer can take his class codes and reuse them in different applications.  And if that code already works, there's saved time and energy.  If that's not enough, thanks to inheritance, OOP lends itself to easy extension. Overarching traits are passed down, and with a few minor adaptations, new additions can be created.  So, large projects become manageable.
          </P>
          <p>
            Building classes involves two files saved in the same folder (though not completely necessary); one will be the class file while the other will be the use of the class--the latter of which requires the former to be imported.  A convention for defining a class, according to the Google style guide, is to capitalize the first letter of the name: <b>class Movie():</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Methods</b> are functions that take class instances are their first argument--they're part of classes.  There are two different types of methods, bound and unbound.  Bound methods automatically pass in the instance because they belong to instances of a class. Unbound methods have to have the instance passed in as a parameter.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>__init__</b>, a special method and <b>constructor</b>, creates space in memory to recall details about the class.  __init__ takes arguments, starting with "self" (or any other word, but self is the convention), comprised of the necessary pieces of information used by the program.  These arguments are defined variables inside the __init__ function, <b>Instance Variables</b>.  Also within the class are <b>Instance Methods</b>, which perform specific tasks when called in the other file.  Within the other file, the use of the class, <b>Instances</b> are created and defined to use the programming saved in the class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just to paraphrase/quote Kunal's definition of these terms: A <b>class</b> is like a blueprint that contains data and methods.  We can create multiple <b>instances</b> of a class.  When those are created, the class' <b>constructor</b> gets called. This is the __init__ method, which initializes all the data associated with the instance.  It uses the keyword <b>Self</b>, which is the instance in question. All of the variables associated with the instance are called <b>instance variables</b>.  They are unique and can be accessed with the self keyword within the class, and the instance name outside the class.  All the functions inside the class associated with an instance and take the argument "self" are <b>instance methods</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Definitions of variables typically change with each instance, but sometimes the instances share variables--class variables.  <b>Class Variables</b> are defined at the class level, outside the __init__ functions. These shared variables are often times constants--which should be named in all capitalized letters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python has built-in class variables, such as __doc__, __name__, or __module__.  __doc__ can be used by triple quoting a pertinent comment within the class, and then calling it with the class name and .__doc__.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Inheritance</b>, previously discussed in this course with CSS, applies to classes in OOP as well. A child class is written to pass in the parent function. A child class will call the instances of the parent class by calling its __init__ function and can also be overwritten--<b>Method Overriding</b>.  Just like in CSS.  Inheritance can be used to increase efficiency and minimize errors.  It can also be used between classes when they share common variables. A parent method can be called by the child function, but by creating the same method within the child, perhaps adding to it, a <b>method override</b> has occurred.  The child class will supplant it's own method over the parent's.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Classes are collections of attributes, but objects have specifically defined attributes. Objects are instantiated. Classes are models.  Objects have specific characteristics.  Human would be a class.  Bill would be an object...and an instance.  Instance-Bill and his wife and her sister would be objects.  
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS allows for inheritance and classes to be created that can be used in multiple applications.

            Parts of a URL. <b>Protocols</b> are rules about how things talk to each other.  Internet protocol is typically HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol. The <b>host</b> is the website (sleepycats.com). <b>Fragments</b>, text following a pound sign, stay client side and do not get sent to the server. <b>Ports</b> are included between host and slash, starting with a semi-colon. The <b>query</b> starts with the question mark.  A <b>path</b>
          </p> 
          <p>
            HTTP request lines have three main parts.  Method-GET or POST, path-/foo, version-HTTP/1.0 or 1.1.  Since the browser is already connected to the host, the host isn't included, which makes this a <b>relative path</b>.  The path can include everything from the slash to the pound sign. <b>Absolute paths</b> have the host included. These requests have several headers--Name: value.  The host, and the user-agent (who makes the request) are two headers 
          </p>
          <p>
            HTTP Responses include a <b>status line</b>, the response to the request line, the <b>status code</b> (200 ok, 302 found, 404 not found, 500 server error). These also have headers like Date, Server (though you can refrain from sharing this for security purposes), Content Type, and Content Length.
          </p>
          <p>
           Servers respond to HTTP requests with two content types: static (pre-written file, image) or dynamic (response built by program). <b>Web applications</b> generate web content.
